A. What's this?

This is a configuration file and parsing script for grsecurity enabled kernels. 
It's pretty basic so far, if you make any improvements please do share them.


B. Installation

1. Copy grsec.conf to /etc/logwatch/conf/services
2. Copy grsec to /etc/logwatch/scripts/services
3. Make grsec script executable 

$ cp grsec.conf /etc/logwatch/config/services/
$ cp grsec /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/
$ chmod +x /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/grsec 


C. Testing 

For testing I'm using logwatch with --output stdout 

$ logwatch --output stdout
